# PokeDex using Vanilla JS

Built this using the template created by Justin Kim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjSaZb67n8&ab_channel=JustinKim

Attempted to build on my own after studying his code and added new features including power on/off button, d pad functionality, a cursor for selected pokemon

Learning core Vanilla JS skills including interacting with an API, promises, arrow functions, etc.
